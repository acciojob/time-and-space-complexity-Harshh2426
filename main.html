  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. Understanding time complexity helps developers write more efficient code by comparing algorithms and choosing the one that performs best under given constraints.</p>

  <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
